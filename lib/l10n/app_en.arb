  "faq1Question": "Why 13 months?",
  "faq1Answer": "13 × 28 = 364 days, just one short of a regular year. Each month has exactly 4 weeks, making scheduling, billing, and planning perfectly regular. The remaining day becomes Year Day, a special holiday.",
  "faq2Question": "What is Sol?",
  "faq2Answer": "Sol is the 7th month, inserted between June and July. It's named after the Sun (Latin \"sol\"). In the IFC, the months after June shift: Sol, July, August, September, October, November, December.",
  "faq3Question": "What is Year Day?",
  "faq3Answer": "Year Day falls after December 28 (the last regular day) and before January 1 of the next year. It belongs to no month and no weekday — it's a universal day off, ensuring every year starts on Sunday.",
  "faq4Question": "How do leap years work?",
  "faq4Answer": "Leap years follow the same rules as the Gregorian calendar (every 4 years, except centuries not divisible by 400). The extra day, Leap Day, is inserted between June 28 and Sol 1. Like Year Day, it has no weekday.",
  "faq5Question": "What day of the week is my birthday?",
  "faq5Answer": "In the IFC, every date falls on the same weekday every year! If your IFC birthday is the 15th, it's always a Sunday. Use the Converter tab to find your IFC birthday.",
  "faq6Question": "Could this calendar actually be adopted?",
  "faq6Answer": "The biggest obstacle is tradition and the disruption of the continuous 7-day Sabbath cycle. Year Day and Leap Day break the weekly pattern, which some religious traditions consider unacceptable. Despite this, the IFC remains one of the most practical calendar reform proposals.",
